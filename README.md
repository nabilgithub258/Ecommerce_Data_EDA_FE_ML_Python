## Introduction
The goal of this project is to predict the annual amount spent by customers based on various features available in the Ecommerce dataset. Accurate predictions can help businesses optimize their marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

## Dataset
The dataset includes various features such as customer demographics, session information, and purchase history. It is used to train and evaluate different regression models to predict annual spending.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involves:
- Understanding the distribution of data
- Identifying missing values
- Detecting outliers
- Analyzing relationships between features and the target variable

## Feature Engineering (FE)
Feature Engineering includes:
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Creating new features based on domain knowledge
- Normalizing/standardizing features

## Modeling
Various regression models were developed and evaluated, including:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- Other advanced regression techniques

## Results
- The best-performing model achieved a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 19.9 and a coefficient of determination (RÂ²) of 0.92.
- The Random Forest Regression model yielded an RMSE of 21.8, demonstrating its robustness as a predictive tool.

## Conclusion
The models developed in this project can effectively predict annual customer spending. These predictions can be leveraged by businesses to enhance their marketing strategies and customer experience.
